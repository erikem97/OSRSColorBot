# OSRSColorBot
This is a colorbot for the video game Old School Runescape, it can fish and mine. It works by taking a screenshot of the client and finding the correct pixel by looking for a certain RGB-value. It also implents threading and objected oriented programing to be able to run multipule bots at the same time.
